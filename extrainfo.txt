1. You should probably test on timestamp existance on bookmark creation to avoid creating duplicates when a user clicks the button several times in a row
2. You should probably deal with storage in background page/service worker, and not in content script. Even though the code in content script will become less beautiful, I guess it is better in terms of architecture. And if you don't care about architecture at all, why just not move that to popup.js? Your content script really does not need to get access to the full bookmarks list in order to add a "plus" button and assign a click handler to it.
3. Maybe you don't have to refetch all the bookmarks after deletion, just add some logic for handling an empty list case (some speed optimization).
4. Finally, Chrome definitely won't allow us to change the active tab leaving the popup opened (though Firefox really allows something like this using a special development option to preserve all opened popups), but we can overprotect ourselves and save the current page url or video id somewhere in popup.js, so that we can be 100% sure that we are deleting the right things.
